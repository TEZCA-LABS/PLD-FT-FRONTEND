/**
 * Route definitions
 * Centralized routing configuration
 */

// This file can be used for more complex routing setups
// For now, routes are defined directly in App.jsx
// You can expand this file to include:
// - Protected routes
// - Route guards
// - Lazy loading
// - Nested routes

export const routes = {
    home: '/',
    login: '/login',
    register: '/register',
    dashboard: '/dashboard',
};
